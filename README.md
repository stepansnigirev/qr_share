# QR code generator with "Share" functionality

A Progressive Web Application that registers itself to the "Share" menu on Android. 

It may be useful if you want to pass some small piece of data between phones.

I use it to show lightning payment preimage as a QR code to prove to the lightning-enabled offline vending machine that I made a payment.

Usage:

1. Open https://stepansnigirev.github.io/qr_share/ on the phone.
2. Click on "Add to home screen" pop-up - you will get a new "app" on the phone.
3. Copy some text and click on "Share" menu - you will see the "QR generator" app as one of the options.
4. Show the QR code with copied data to someone.
